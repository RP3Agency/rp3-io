				</header>

				<p class="chapter__intro-paragraph">5 years ago, Norfolk Southern railway came to us with a multi-faceted challenge. They faced a tough regulatory environment and needed to focus their efforts on reaching a small, but hard to influence target: federal policy makers and the opinion elites who influence them.</p>

				<p>Yet at the same time, they needed to garner public support and create advocates at the state and local level in communities across their footprint in order to move ahead with numerous expansion projects and public-private partnerships vital to their business... railroads used to flying under the radar... cant do it anymore due to issues like crude by rail...</p>

				<p>They also recognized that they were not speaking consistently across the organization or in their efforts to reach secondary audiences such as shippers, investors and job recruits as effectively as they could. There were silos within the organization using vastly different approaches with no agreement on common themes or language.</p>

				<p>Meanwhile, the industry trade group (AAR) had its own campaign aimed at policy makers inside the beltway, but it was not unique or differentiating for Norfolk Southern. How could they toe the industry line, but step away enough to create some competitive differentiation?</p>

				<p>Recognizing the complexity of the task, we undertook a strategic process to identify audience insights, examine the cultural landscape and uncover the fundamental brand truth that could serve as the jumping off point for developing an integrated communications platform.</p>

				</header>

				<div class="chapter__subsection">

					<h3 class="chapter__subsection__header">Insights:</h3>

					<p class="chapter__intro-paragraph">Norfolk Southern–and the rail industry in general–was perceived by many to be old, outdated and irrelevant. Their trains were basically invisible, except when there was a derailment on the evening news or you were stuck waiting for one at a crossing. How could we possibly get people to see past that and make them care?</p>

					<p>Research showed that almost everyone shared a childlike wonder about trains and viewed them with a sense of nostalgia. When kids see a train it sparks the imagination and conjures up grand ideas of the amazing things train can do. We needed to tap into those feelings of awe and wonder that and attach them to the current and future operations of Norfolk Southern in order to forge a stronger connection between the brand and its audiences. We needed an idea that would allow us to go beyond tracks and rail cars, and getting freight from A to B, and talk about the amazing things that Northern Southern makes possible</p>

				</div>

				<div class="chapter__subsection">

					<h3 class="chapter__subsection__header">Brand Truth:</h3>

					<p>With over 20,000 miles of track in 22 states, and thousands of trains in operation daily, there’s no limit to the amazing things Norfolk Southern can do for the national economy the communities they serve, not to mention their customers, investors and employees.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="chapter__subsection">

					<h3 class="chapter__subsection__header">The Concept:</h3>

					<p>That brand truth led to the concept of <strong>One Line, infinite Possibilities</strong>. Not just a new tagline, a whole new platform that would allow us to weave interconnected stories and messages to multiple audiences consistently, relevantly and emotionally.</p>

					<p>Rather than speaking to a set of disconnected silos, we would now communicate with one voice and deliver relevant messages that resonate with each audience in order to build social and economic value throughout the organization.</p>

					</h2>
				</header>

				<div class="chapter__subsection">

					<h3 class="chapter__subsection__header">Economic Possibilities:</h3>

					<p>To reach our primary audience of policy makers and those who influence them, we defined Infinite Possibilities mainly in economic terms by reinforcing how Norfolk Southern impacts  economic development, job creation, and global competitiveness.</p>

					<p>But to keep those messages from sounding overly rational, we tapped into people’s childlike wonder of rail with innovative, high production value television spots.</p>

					<p>And we continued the story with a campaign microsite that offered more detailed storytelling and sharable content. And policy makers could delve as deep as they wanted to with state-specific statistics and information tailored for policy makers.</p>

					<p>Our paid media buy focused primarily on political and financial programming, supported with digital buys that offered the right kind of context and dialogue. For example, we sponsored “Limited Commercial Interruption” coverage of election results on Fox News.</p>

					<p>We also sponsored innovative online features like the “Social Media Mention Tool” on the Washington Post Online. This innovative tool tracked which election–related topics were trending in real time. With each digital placement, we continued the conversation by linking users to microsites and other content that increased personal relevance and encouraged sharing.</p>
