						<p class="chapter__intro-paragraph">5 years ago, Norfolk Southern railway came to us with a multi-faceted challenge. They faced a tough regulatory environment and needed to focus their efforts on reaching a small, but hard to influence target: federal policy makers and the opinion elites who influence them.</p>

						<p>Yet at the same time, they needed to garner public support and create advocates at the state and local level in communities across their footprint in order to move ahead with numerous expansion projects and public-private partnerships vital to their business... railroads used to flying under the radar... cant do it anymore due to issues like crude by rail...</p>

						<p>They also recognized that they were not speaking consistently across the organization or in their efforts to reach secondary audiences such as shippers, investors and job recruits as effectively as they could. There were silos within the organization using vastly different approaches with no agreement on common themes or language.</p>

						<p>Meanwhile, the industry trade group (AAR) had its own campaign aimed at policy makers inside the beltway, but it was not unique or differentiating for Norfolk Southern. How could they toe the industry line, but step away enough to create some competitive differentiation?</p>

						<p>Recognizing the complexity of the task, we undertook a strategic process to identify audience insights, examine the cultural landscape and uncover the fundamental brand truth that could serve as the jumping off point for developing an integrated communications platform.</p>

							<h3 class="chapter__subsection__header">Insights:</h3>

							<p class="chapter__intro-paragraph">Norfolk Southern–and the rail industry in general–was perceived by many to be old, outdated and irrelevant. Their trains were basically invisible, except when there was a derailment on the evening news or you were stuck waiting for one at a crossing. How could we possibly get people to see past that and make them care?</p>

							<p>Research showed that almost everyone shared a childlike wonder about trains and viewed them with a sense of nostalgia. When kids see a train it sparks the imagination and conjures up grand ideas of the amazing things train can do. We needed to tap into those feelings of awe and wonder that and attach them to the current and future operations of Norfolk Southern in order to forge a stronger connection between the brand and its audiences. We needed an idea that would allow us to go beyond tracks and rail cars, and getting freight from A to B, and talk about the amazing things that Northern Southern makes possible</p>

						</div>

						<div class="chapter__subsection">

							<h3 class="chapter__subsection__header">Brand Truth:</h3>

							<p>With over 20,000 miles of track in 22 states, and thousands of trains in operation daily, there’s no limit to the amazing things Norfolk Southern can do for the national economy the communities they serve, not to mention their customers, investors and employees.</p>

						</div>

					</div>

				</div>

				<!-- <div class="chapter__subsection">

					<h3 class="chapter__subsection__header">The Concept:</h3>

					<p>That brand truth led to the concept of <strong>One Line, infinite Possibilities</strong>. Not just a new tagline, a whole new platform that would allow us to weave interconnected stories and messages to multiple audiences consistently, relevantly and emotionally.</p>

					<p>Rather than speaking to a set of disconnected silos, we would now communicate with one voice and deliver relevant messages that resonate with each audience in order to build social and economic value throughout the organization.</p>

					<p>To reach our primary audience of policy makers and those who influence them, we defined Infinite Possibilities mainly in economic terms by reinforcing how Norfolk Southern impacts  economic development, job creation, and global competitiveness.</p>

					<p>But to keep those messages from sounding overly rational, we tapped into people’s childlike wonder of rail with innovative, high production value television spots.</p>

					<p>And we continued the story with a campaign microsite that offered more detailed storytelling and sharable content. And policy makers could delve as deep as they wanted to with state-specific statistics and information tailored for policy makers.</p>

					<p>Our paid media buy focused primarily on political and financial programming, supported with digital buys that offered the right kind of context and dialogue. For example, we sponsored “Limited Commercial Interruption” coverage of election results on Fox News.</p>

					<p>We also sponsored innovative online features like the “Social Media Mention Tool” on the Washington Post Online. This innovative tool tracked which election–related topics were trending in real time. With each digital placement, we continued the conversation by linking users to microsites and other content that increased personal relevance and encouraged sharing.</p>

					<p>Because this audience was so hard to reach and influence, we didn’t rely on paid media alone, we amplified our reach by creating our own media channels. One such example involved working with the Washington Post to host a live forum on the nation's crumbling infrastructure, as part of their “Post Live” series.</p>

					<p>Held in the Nation’s Capital and streamed live on the web, Attendees included US Department of Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, Rep. John Mica, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Jim Oberstar, Former Chairman, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, among other policy-makers and thought leaders from the transportation industry.</p>

					<p>The event generated significant news coverage and social media commentary, reinforcing Norfolk Southern as a leader that helps make great things possible for our nation’s economic future.</p>

					<p>We also engaged this “inside-the-beltway” audience through our sponsorship of the Washington Nationals, where we became the name sponsor of one of the club levels at Nationals Park.</p>

					<p>We use the space not just for entertaining legislators and their staffers, but also to educate and inform fans, many of who fit the mindset of our policy influencer audience. Interactive features including the world’s first scoreboard made entirely of trains continue the theme of childlike wonder.</p>

					<p class="chapter__intro-paragraph">A second, but equally important group of people we need to influence are what we call “Opinion Elites.’ These are civically engaged citizens in key communities throughout Norfolk Southern’s footprint, and we need them to understand all the great things Norfolk Southern makes possible in their communities, from economic development, to job creation, to safety.</p>

					<p>These people are crucial because their support and cooperation is required in order for Norfolk Southern to expand facilities, build new track, or get approval for public-private projects to improve our infrastructure or increase shipping capacity.</p>

					<img class="img__med-left" alt="Federal policy makers first image" src="./images/chapter-4/train.jpg"/>

					<p>Historically this wasn’t an issue for railroads, because hundreds of regional railroads crisscrossed the country, stopping in every small town along the way. Everyone knew someone who worked on the rails. But as technology improved and trains stopped less often, and the industry consolidated into a handful of national players, those connections were lost. To help re-establish those ties, we initiated a number of efforts at the community level.</p>

					<p>One of the things we did to help re-establish those ties was the Heritage Program, in which NS painted 20 locomotives in the historic paint schemes of their most storied predecessor railroads. We saw the possibility to turn each one of those Heritage locomotives into an even bigger source of pride for the community it represented. So we turned them into 200-ton media vehicles.</p>

					<p>After a series of highly anticipated unveilings, these trains met up for a family portrait on July 4th. The event attracted a crowd of almost 10,000 people and was one of the most talked about gatherings in the company’s history. To commemorate the moment, we created a set of trading cards and worked with local newspapers to place stories honoring the contributions of each predecessor railroad.</p>

					<p>We also built a mobile app that allowed people to share photographs and track them as they continued their work hauling freight across the network. The app also allows users to find rail landmarks and events near them, compete in trivia contests, and earn badges for their accomplishments—all of which helps encourage sharing and engagement.</p>

					<p>Other efforts to engage and educate at the community level include “Load the Line” an interactive game built for their traveling exhibit car, “Protect the Line” a safety program that enables local residents to easily report issues to the company. Every step of the way, we captured emails and kept people informed and engaged so that if we ever needed their assistance on a legislative issue, we could call on them.</p>

					<p class="chapter__intro-paragraph">The next audience we needed to reach was one that might seem like the most important; Norfolk Southern’s shipping customers. But the relationship between railroad and shipper is far from typical, and the decision to work together is determined by a myriad of factors outside of their control. Often it boils down to simple geography.</p>

					<p>What we could influence though, was the fact that many shippers are unaware that rail is even a possibility for them, or they have outdated perceptions. That’s because the transportation industry is changing rapidly, and a new breed of logistics professionals are entering the field. These new potential customers tend to be younger, more tech-savvy, and less knowledgeable about rail compared to trucking. Meanwhile, there’s a growing demand by corporations to reduce the carbon footprint of their supply chain, which also makes rail a new possibility to consider.</p>

					<p>Unfortunately, Norfolk Southern’s website had little information specifically created for such prospects. It was focused more on facilitating transactions for current customers.To fix that, we undertook a total rebuild of their digital footprint, condensing multiple outdated sites into one clean, fully responsive website.</p>

					<p>A “New to Rail?” section was added to explain the what, where and how of shipping with Norfolk Southern. Interactive maps and tools were developed to show how the system could meet each customer’s needs. And for the first time, clear communication funnels were set up to connect users directly to the right contact person to answer any questions and begin the onboarding process. The ultimate goal was to deliver more qualified leads to the marketing team.</p>

				</div>

				<div class="chapter__subsection">

					<h3 class="chapter__subsection__header">Results:</h3>

					<p class="chapter__intro-paragraph">In the first few months alone, over 150 new leads came in through the new website, which is impressive considering we were starting from a baseline of zero. Each lead has huge potential value for Norfolk Southern. For example, one new contract generated $3 million in incremental revenue within the first few months.</p>

					<p class="chapter__intro-paragraph">Attracting and retaining the next generation of employees has always been a challenge for Norfolk Southern because freight railroads don’t often get credit for building innovative, forward-thinking businesses. So galvanizing their workforce around a set of shared values, and communicating those values to potential employees was also important.</p>

					<p>The fact is, Norfolk Southern is ahead of the curve when it comes to issues younger workers care about, such as sustainability and supporting local communities. So starting with their workforce of 30,000+ employees, we built an integrated communications program around the theme of Connections. The program goes beyond the literal ties on tracks that connect ports, highways and warehouses, to highlight the invisible (and often stronger) ties that connect everyone at Norfolk Southern to communities, the land and each other.</p>

					<p>The program centered on owned and earned channels to spark conversation among employees and foster sharing and involvement with their local communities.</p>

					<p>Videos highlighted efforts in the areas of reforestation, use of renewable materials and volunteerism, with a special emphasis on employees and their role in the company’s success.</p>

					<p>Since many employees work along the rails with no internet access, we created a text-based Connections Challenge, which encourages positive actions and fosters healthy competition between various departments.</p>
